# Coursera-Project-Human-Activity-Recognition

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

This repository describes the files components associated to the "Coursera Project: Human Activity Recognition", a final assignment project included in the course "Getting and Cleaning Data ", corresponding to the Coursera Specialization "Foundations Using R" from the John Hopkins University.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set to comply with the following review criteria:

1.     The submitted data set is tidy.

2.     The Github repo contains the required scripts.

3.     GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available code books with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

4.     The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

5.     The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

FILES

1.  CodeBook.md - It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
2.  run_analysis.R - The R script that executes the algorithm to load the data files from internet, to transfer the data to memory to be cleaned, transformed, merged, summarized and prepared the final output file to be be used for later analysis.
3.  summary_by_subj_activ.txt - The output file that contains a summarized mean of each variable grouped by subject and activity.
4.  README.md - This file that describes the purpose, goal, and files components of this project.
